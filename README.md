## üìã Overview

UniVoice is a decentralized AI voice generation and management platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). It enables users to create, manage, and utilize AI-generated voice models through a system of canisters and distributed computing nodes.

The platform consists of several interconnected components:
- **Interface Canister (OpenAPI)**: Provides API access points for applications
- **VMC (Voice Model Canister)**: Manages voice model data and operations
- **AGC (Assert Canisters Group)**: Handles asset management and orchestration
- **Comfyui Nodes**: Distributed computing resources for AI processing

## üìê Architecture

UniVoice employs a modular architecture built on ICP canisters with distributed computing nodes:

*Diagram 2: Detailed architecture showing the data flow between components*

### Key Components:

1. **Interface Canister (OpenAPI)**: 
   - Entry point for third-party integrations
   - Handles authentication and request routing
   - Connects to various blockchain networks (EVM, IoT, AWS)

2. **VMC (Voice Model Canister)**:
   - Manages voice model data and operations
   - Handles mining site operations
   - Processes voice model generation requests

3. **AGC (Assert Canisters Group)**:
   - Orchestrates AI workflows
   - Manages governance for model updates
   - Handles AI data assets (workflows, prompts, models)

4. **Comfyui Nodes**:
   - Distributed computing resources
   - Inner nodes for secure processing
   - Local nodes for edge computing

5. **IC-OSS Storage**:
   - Decentralized object storage service
   - Handles file management and access control
   - Supports the storage of models and generated content

dfx deploy
```

### Deploying IC-OSS Storage

```bash
# Deploy ic_oss_bucket
dfx deploy ic_oss_bucket --argument "(opt variant {Init =
  record {
    name = \"Univoice Labs\";
    file_id = 0;
    max_file_size = 2048;
    max_folder_depth = 10;
    max_children = 1000;
    visibility = 0;
    max_custom_data_size = 4096;
    enable_hash_index = false;
  }
})"

# Deploy ic_oss_cluster
